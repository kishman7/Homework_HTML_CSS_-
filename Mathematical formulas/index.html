    <h2>Mathematical formulas</h2>
    <h4>Linear Equations</h4>
    <p>A linear equation is any eq uation that can be written in the form</p>
    <p class="formula"> <mark> ax + b = 0</mark> </p>
    <p>
        where <span class="spanLetter"> a </span> and <span class="spanLetter">b</span> are real numbers and <span class="spanLetter">x</span> is a variable. This form is sometimes called the standard form of a linear equation. Note that most linear equations will not start off in this form. Also, the variable may or may not be an <span class="spanLetter">x</span> so donâ€™t get too locked into always seeing an <span class="spanLetter">x</span> there.
    </p>

    <h4>Quadratic Equation</h4>
    <p>The standard form of a quadratic equation looks like this:</p>
    <p class="formula"><mark>ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0</mark> </p>
    <p>where <span class="spanLetter">a</span>, <span class="spanLetter">b</span>, <span class="spanLetter">c</span> are known values and <span class="spanLetter">x</span> is the variable or unknown (we don't know it yet). Also, <span class="spanLetter">a</span> can't be 0.</p>
    
    <h4>The area of a circle (A)</h4>
    <p ><span id="pi">&pi;</span> (Pi) times the radius (<span class="spanLetter">b</span>, <span class="spanLetter">c</span> are known values and <span class="spanLetter">x</span> is the variable or unknown (we don't know it yet). Also, (<span class="spanLetter">r</span>) squared:</p>
    <p class="formula"><mark>A = <span >&pi;</span> &times; r<sup>2</sup> </mark></p>
    <p>or, when you know the diameter (<span class="spanLetter">D</span>):</p>
    <p class="formula"><mark> A = (&pi; / 4) &times; D<sup>2</sup></mark></p>
    <p>or, when you know the circumference (<span class="spanLetter">C</span>):</p>
    <p class="formula"><mark> A = C<sup>2</sup> / 4 &times; &pi;</mark></p>

    <h4>Intersection</h4>
    <p>The intersection of two sets <span class="spanLetter">A</span> and <span class="spanLetter">B</span>, denoted by A &cap; B, is the set of all objects that are members of both the sets A and B. In symbols,</p>
    <p class="formula"><mark> A &cap; B = { &times; : &times; &isin; A and x &isin; B }</mark></p>
    <p>That is, <span class="spanLetter">x</span> is an element of the intersection A &cap; B if and only if <span class="spanLetter">x</span> is both an element of <span class="spanLetter">A</span> and an element of <span class="spanLetter">B</span>.</p>
